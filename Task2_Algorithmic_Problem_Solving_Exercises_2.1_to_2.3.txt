Task 2: Algorithmic Problem Solving
-------------------------------------------------
Exercises 2.1 to 2.3
-------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2.1:
-------------------------------------------------
Aim:
To arrange the given functions in increasing order of asymptotic (Big O) growth.

Functions:
1. log n
2. n
3. n log n
4. n^2
5. n^3
6. 2^n
7. n!
8. √n
9. log(log n)

Result (in increasing order):
log(log n) < log n < √n < n < n log n < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n < n!

Conclusion:
Logarithmic functions grow the slowest, while factorial growth dominates all others.


Exercise 2.2 and 2.3:
-------------------------------------------------
Aim:
To order the given functions according to their growth rate (from slowest to fastest).

Given Functions:
6n^3, n log6n, 4n, 8n^2, log2n, n log2n, log8n, 64, 8^2n

Step 1 – Simplify the terms:
- log8n and log2n → same asymptotic order O(log n)
- n log6n and n log2n → same asymptotic order O(n log n)
- 4n and constants (64) → linear and constant respectively
- 6n^3, 8n^2 → polynomial (cubic and quadratic)
- 8^2n → exponential

Step 2 – Arrange from smallest to largest:
64 < log8n < log2n < 4n < n log6n = n log2n < 8n^2 < 6n^3 < 8^2n

Conclusion:
Constants grow slowest, followed by logarithmic, linear, linearithmic, polynomial, and exponential functions.

-------------------------------------------------
Final Summary:
-------------------------------------------------
Order of common growth rates from slowest to fastest:
1. Constant (O(1))
2. Logarithmic (O(log n))
3. Square Root (O(√n))
4. Linear (O(n))
5. Linearithmic (O(n log n))
6. Polynomial (O(n^2), O(n^3))
7. Exponential (O(2^n), O(8^n))
8. Factorial (O(n!))

Hence, as the input size (n) increases, factorial and exponential functions grow the fastest,
while constant and logarithmic functions grow the slowest.
