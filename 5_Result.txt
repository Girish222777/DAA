Result:
The time complexities and orders of growth for the given algorithms are:

1. Linear Search   → O(n)        → Linear Growth
2. Binary Search   → O(log n)    → Logarithmic Growth
3. Bubble Sort     → O(n^2)      → Quadratic Growth
4. Merge Sort      → O(n log n)  → Linearithmic Growth

Hence, Merge Sort is more efficient than Bubble Sort for large input sizes.
